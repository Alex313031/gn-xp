      "message": "Hi, this is my attempt at coming up with a (very) stripped down version of Petr\u0027s work in https://gn-review.googlesource.com/c/gn/+/7401 so that we can get something landed that\u0027s not too much of an investment and get to try out modules in Fuchsia\u0027s build.\n\nThe main simplifications are:\n1) .modulemap files (which define the module\u0027s public API) have to be written by hand\n2) only C++ is supported (i.e. not C, ObjC, ObjC++)\n\nThis first small CL adds support for .modulemap in \"sources\" which are compiled (to .pcm) by a \"cxx_module\" tool that\u0027s expected to exist.\n\nThe second CL adds support for \"module_deps\", which is like \"deps\" but also builds a helper cflags_cc ninja variable to depend on other module targets.\n\nI believe these two would be sufficient to start incrementally working on modules in the Fuchsia build based on experiments here: https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/412605\n\nDoes this seem OK? I thought I would send it out for a look before I write up a bunch of boilerplate in unittests. (Let me know if I can help walk you through the module building flags, they\u0027re a bit futzy/underdocumented if you\u0027re not familiar with them.)",

      "message": "I like this split, even long-term.  When we add automagic modulemap generation, that can be `generated_file() { output_conversion \u003d \"modulemap\" }` or something, and then using generated module maps would just be normal use of a `sources \u003d [ \"$target_gen_dir/$output_name.modulemap\" ]` with deps on the generator target.",

      "message": "Hi Brett! I saw your comments on CL in February, when I recently looked into what it would take to have gn allow a project to migrate to Python 3.\n\nOne big difference is that you asked that script runners be a new *variable*. However it seemed to me to work better if it were a *function*, so that is what I implemented it as.\n\nI went much further than this with some local changes I haven\u0027t yet uploaded, such as updating exec_script() to itself take a \"runner\" argument (while remaining backwards compatible!), and otherwise entirely eliminating BuildSettings::{set_}python_path(). Those other changes were ... interesting, so to start I kept it simple. Only action and action_foreach can specify a runner other than \"python\" (and can be constrained to not allow \"python\" at all). Everything else is unaffected.\n\nPTAL.",

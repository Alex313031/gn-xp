      "message": "I started this with the plan of calling ProcessFileExtensions from set_python_path, but set_python_path is just a setter and is in a different class. Doing so would prevent the validity check that is in the default path and just didn\u0027t \"feel\" right.\n\nBut! I dramatically cleaned up the code - fixing several bugs in the process - so that I don\u0027t think the duplicate calls to ProcessFileExtensions are really a problem anymore.\n\nNone of the bugs that I fixed are serious - they are in edge cases that will normally not be hit or that are harmless. So, take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think.\n",

      "message": "I think this basically looks right.\n\nHowever, since you\u0027re cleaning things up anyway ...\n\nTechnically, GN in theory doesn\u0027t actually require script_executable to be a python binary; you\u0027re supposed to be free to use whatever executable you want. I believe Fuchsia actually uses `/usr/bin/env`, for example.\n\nHowever, that isn\u0027t true on Windows in some cases (even before this CL), since we may do the .bat -\u003e .exe dance. We might want to be a little more careful about this and only do the .bat -\u003e .exe dance if the script_executable contains \"python\" as a string (to allow for \"vpython\" and \"python2\").\n\nOr, we might want to do that in a separate CL, since it is actually a different change.\n\n+brettw for thoughts.",

      "message": "Yeah, I think we ideally would want to support other languanges (that\u0027s why this is called \"script\" executable). But I don\u0027t think this change really makes it better or worse so I don\u0027t think we should be worrying about it here. And since nobody has complained, it\u0027s probably pretty low priority. Maybe just file a bug to track?",

      "message": "I believe we do support other languages. I tried with --script-executable\u003dperl (and perl.exe) and those both work. The variable names inside the gn source are a bit odd in that context, but it does work (the gn part - obviously Chromium fails to build when it tries to run Python scripts through perl).\n\nSupporting .bat file translation would require special-case code for each scripting language but that can easily be added as needed.\n\nSo, I\u0027m not even sure we need a bug, unless there is a specific language that you want to add support for right now.",

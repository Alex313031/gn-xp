      "message": "I started this with the plan of calling ProcessFileExtensions from set_python_path, but set_python_path is just a setter and is in a different class. Doing so would prevent the validity check that is in the default path and just didn\u0027t \"feel\" right.\n\nBut! I dramatically cleaned up the code - fixing several bugs in the process - so that I don\u0027t think the duplicate calls to ProcessFileExtensions are really a problem anymore.\n\nNone of the bugs that I fixed are serious - they are in edge cases that will normally not be hit or that are harmless. So, take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think.\n",

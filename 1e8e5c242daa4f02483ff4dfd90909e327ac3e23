      "message": "I have updated RJ\u0027s previous CL to make it work with current GN and simplify it a little. I have also performed measurements to see how this improves the situation. Sadly, that does not seem to speed up the build *at all* on my workstation. More precisely:\n\n- clean build time seems totally unaffected on my workstation, either with a cold or hot file system cache (I\u0027m using \"echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\"). I\u0027d like to try on my CloudTop (which is notorious for hideous I/O) though.\n\n- \"gn gen\" mean time is slightly faster (e.g. 13.7s -\u003e 12.9s)\n- Generated .ninja files are slightly smaller (i.e. 768 MiB -\u003e 736 MiB).\n- Mean \"ninja -C out/default -n\" time is slightly smaller (8.85s -\u003e 8.13s).\n- Max \"ninja -C out/default -n\" RSS peak is slightly smaller (1.047 GiB -\u003e 1.034 GiB).\n\nKeep in mind that still requires a custom Ninja binary built from upstream HEAD since there is no official release, and setting \"no_stamp_files \u003d true\" in the //.gn file, so it\u0027s not something we can roll to the Fuchsia build yet.\n\nTell me what you think about this. I will clean up this mega-CL into 3 separate ones for better review. I\u0027m still not sure it\u0027s worth it.\n",

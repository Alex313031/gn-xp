      "message": "Yes, the issue is that these flags only apply to modules. Specifically some of these flags apply to module compilation itself which is a separate rule, some apply to any C/C++/Objective-C rule that uses modules and I haven\u0027t quite figured the most elegant way to express this.\n\nOne idea I\u0027ve experimented with was having a dedicated tool (e.g. cc_module) and put these flags there. The downside was that it was quite verbose since you need at least 4 different tools: cc_module, cxx_module, objc_module, objcxx_module.\n\nAnother idea I considered is to introduce another variable, e.g. cflags_modules, which would contain flags that are used for compiling modules. The issue is that -fmodule-name\u003d contains the module name which has to match the name in the modulemap file and for autogenerated modulemap files, it\u0027d be the label. Ideally we would use -fmodule-name\u003d{{module_name}} expansion, but expansions cannot be used in configs, at least no today.\n\nDo you have any other ideas?",

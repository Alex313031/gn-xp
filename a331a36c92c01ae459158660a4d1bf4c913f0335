At best you could hack some things to build it on macOS 11, but we should put zero engineering effort into toolchain improvements for building Chrome on anything as ancient and unsupported as macOS 10.14.\n\nIf this is not intended for use on Chrome, we should talk, as 10.14 is four years old and no toolset from Apple has supported it for development since January 2020.",

      "message": "One more small change that I included in this CL -- {{label_no_toolchain}} seems like a better module name to use. Using {{label}} seemed fine but once it\u0027s a host toolchain or whatever it doesn\u0027t really make sense, i.e. having to call it:\n\n    module \"//zircon/tools/kazoo:kazoo_lib(//build/toolchain:host_x64)\"\n\nvs\n\n    module \"//zircon/tools/kazoo:kazoo_lib\"\n\nSince the module name is a source concept, the unadorned module name seems right.",

      "message": "I get nervous about uninitialized bare pointers. We could default-initialize this to null, but it looks like you only create this in one place. Maybe create a real constructor (with no default constructor) that sets the values so we don\u0027t have to worry about uninitialized ones? The you can even do emplace_back in the call site and I think it becomes much shorter.",

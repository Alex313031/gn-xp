But //b has given it visibility as b::c.\n\nIf c changes, a could need to recompile since it\u0027s using `b::c::foo`. But without public_deps c would be excluded from a\u0027s dependency set here.\n\nSo, we either include all non-visible crates as well, or we need to ensure somehow that a re-export means it\u0027s listed in public_deps somehow..?",

      "message": "It seems like there could be conflicts here if one target says \"foo\u003dbar\" and another says \"foo\u003dsomethingelse\". This seems especially bad since there is no attribution on these so \"gn desc\" can\u0027t say where the value comes from to help fix the problem. And I\u0027m more paranoid about being clear here since it seems this will be used in more complex cases than \"libs\"",

I forgot to do that but that\u0027s something we should definitely do.",

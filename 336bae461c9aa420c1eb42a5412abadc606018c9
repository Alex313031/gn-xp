      "message": "I think in the bug description you actually have A and B reversed (B depends on A). Can you rewrite this description to match that, to avoid confusion?\n\nThat said, I *think* your analysis is correct and it should be safe to remove the dependency so that you can compile things earlier, but I\u0027m curious to see if brettw thinks of a case I\u0027m not thinking of.\n\nObviously, this is somewhat risky in the case where public_deps is wrong. Do we know if `gn check` will catch that and complain?",

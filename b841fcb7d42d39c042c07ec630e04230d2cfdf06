      "message": "Can you use a dedicated C++ class (here or in the BuildSetting implementation) to ensure that the print callback is restored to its previous value on scope exit? In particular because I still maintain my own \"query persistent server\" mode where you can run multiple GN commands from the same in-memory graph.\n\nAlso what do you think about _not_ printing anything in this case instead?\n\nThis type of change would probably need to be clearly documented too.",

Chromium has a tool that is looking for .stamp.runtime_deps files, which fails because we don\u0027t have the stamp files. This made me realize we were writing runtime_deps files to the out/phony directory, which we probably don\u0027t actually want to do.\n\nHere\u0027s the attempted Chromium roll: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2472601",

      "message": "Because in every other cases, we don\u0027t consider data_deps in the EnsureFileIsGeneratedByDependency walk -- most outputs are generated by building the relevant Ninja target, and therefore will not be accessible from data (order-only) deps calls as they simply won\u0027t exist yet.\n\nRuntime deps files (and the write_data generated file) are special cases, because you *can* depend on them via data_deps. Since they\u0027re written by GN at gen time, they\u0027re guaranteed to exist before any ninja is called. The logic here is allowing that to happen (and also explains the need to track the file generation in the scheduler so we know when to run the check.",

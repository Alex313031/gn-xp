      "message": "I guess in theory if the toolchain\u0027s \"asm\" tool wasn\u0027t clang, this might cause problems? But I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to tell that without pattern matching on the \"command\" of the tool, which wouldn\u0027t be great.\n\nSo I think this is probably fine, and we could probably add some configurability if we needed it later.\n\nCould you add a short test to compile_commands_writer_test.cc too please?",

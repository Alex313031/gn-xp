      "message": "I don\u0027t quite understand what\u0027s going on here. Can this mention why Rust needs all static libraries of dependencies? What about source sets? Coming from a C++ perspective, needing to link static libraries but not source sets doesn\u0027t make any sense.\n\nAlso, I found the wording here confusing. Can you remove \"(even incomplete)\" and use \"all\". This is misleading because complete-vs-incomplete never matters when linking a static library into something else like an executable, they all get added. The only reason a complete static library will matter is when it\u0027s the type of target_ in this class.",

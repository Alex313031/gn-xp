      "message": "This file is autogenerated. The change needs to be done to src/gn/functions.cc instead.\n\nAlso, the recommended way to perform filtering is to explicitly use check when assigning source files to sources.\n\nThat is if you have the following code:\n\n  global_source_assignment_filter \u003d []\n  if (!is_win) { global_sources_assignment_filter +\u003d [ \"*_win.*\" ] }\n  if (!is_mac) { global_sources_assignment_filter +\u003d [ \"*_mac.*\" ] }\n  ...\n  set_sources_assignment_filter(global_sources_assignment_filter)\n  ...\n\n  sources_set(\"foo\") {\n    sources \u003d [\n      \"foo.h\",\n      \"foo_win.cc\",\n      \"foo_mac.cc\",\n    ]\n  }\n\nthen the recommended way to convert is the following:\n\n  sources_set(\"foo\") {\n    sources \u003d [ \"foo.h\" ]\n    if (is_win) { sources +\u003d [ \"foo_win.cc\" ] }\n    if (is_mac) { sources +\u003d [ \"foo_mac.cc\" ] }\n  }\n\nSo I don\u0027t think we want to recommend using filter_exclude here.",

      "message": "Ah - this is my first try at committing something to the GN project. Thanks for letting me know that this file is generated. \n\nFor source includes, I totally agree with your standpoint. There could perhaps be other more complex use cases of set_sources_assignment_filter. For example it could be used in tandem with get_target_outputs inside of a template - and that would make it hard to replace with an explicit list. \n\nWould a corrected version of this patch be accepted, or should I drop it?",

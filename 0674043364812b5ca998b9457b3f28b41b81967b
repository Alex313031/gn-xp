      "message": "This file is autogenerated. The change needs to be done to src/gn/functions.cc instead.\n\nAlso, the recommended way to perform filtering is to explicitly use check when assigning source files to sources.\n\nThat is if you have the following code:\n\n  global_source_assignment_filter \u003d []\n  if (!is_win) { global_sources_assignment_filter +\u003d [ \"*_win.*\" ] }\n  if (!is_mac) { global_sources_assignment_filter +\u003d [ \"*_mac.*\" ] }\n  ...\n  set_sources_assignment_filter(global_sources_assignment_filter)\n  ...\n\n  sources_set(\"foo\") {\n    sources \u003d [\n      \"foo.h\",\n      \"foo_win.cc\",\n      \"foo_mac.cc\",\n    ]\n  }\n\nthen the recommended way to convert is the following:\n\n  sources_set(\"foo\") {\n    sources \u003d [ \"foo.h\" ]\n    if (is_win) { sources +\u003d [ \"foo_win.cc\" ] }\n    if (is_mac) { sources +\u003d [ \"foo_mac.cc\" ] }\n  }\n\nSo I don\u0027t think we want to recommend using filter_exclude here.",

      "message": "Ah - this is my first try at committing something to the GN project. Thanks for letting me know that this file is generated. \n\nFor source includes, I totally agree with your standpoint. There could perhaps be other more complex use cases of set_sources_assignment_filter. For example it could be used in tandem with get_target_outputs inside of a template - and that would make it hard to replace with an explicit list. \n\nWould a corrected version of this patch be accepted, or should I drop it?",

      "message": "Using set_sources_assignment_filter to filter other things that sources was already a hack that was not really recommended. It is true that filter_exclude was added to properly support that use case.\n\nThe function set_sources_assignment_filter will eventually be removed. When this happen, the documentation will also be removed. I think a better location for the information may be docs/faq.md in a new point. Something like:\n\n  ## How to work with list/strings?\n\n  gn provides some intrinsics functions to perform operations on list and\n  strings.\n\n  -   `filter_include` takes a list of strings and a list of patterns and\n      returns a list with all the elements matching any of the patterns\n\n  -   `filter_exclude` takes a list of strings and a list of patterns and\n      returns a list with all the elements matching none of the patterns\n\n  -  `string_replace` takes a string, a pattern and a substitution and\n     returns a new string with all occurrence of the pattern replaced by\n     the substitution\n\n  -  `foreach` allow you to iterate over a list.\n\n  For more information, consult `gn help $function`.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think brettw should be involved in the discussion (since they were initially reluctant to adding those functions, so I\u0027m not sure whether adding emphasis on them would be accepted).",

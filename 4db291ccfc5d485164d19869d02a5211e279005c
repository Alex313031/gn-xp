      "message": "In my previous comments I assumed that we could emit some phony rule name that would build that target so the caller doesn\u0027t need to special-case \"no output\". Then you could always just pipe the output of \"gn outputs\" to ninja or some other tool and it would do what you wanted.\n\nI guess I was mistaken because in the case of the omitted rule, is there anything we can emit here that would make sense? I think the target outputs already emits phony rules if there is one that can be emitted, right?\n\nI guess that\u0027s the best we can do. In that case, I think it would be less problematic for integration scripts to have no output than have an error message.",

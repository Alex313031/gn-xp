      "message": "Thanks for checking!\n\nAha, apparently clang doesn\u0027t add this if you pass -static-libstdc++: http://llvm-cs.pcc.me.uk/tools/clang/lib/Driver/ToolChains/CommonArgs.cpp#1125\n\nI wonder why. It feels like we\u0027re holding something wrong. -static-libgcc will probably also make the link go and remove the gcc_s.so dep, but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s better. (Since we don\u0027t link against anything that throws exceptions, it should at least be safe.)\n\nIf you remind me Tue in a week, I can look at it some more (not at a linux box before then :-/)",

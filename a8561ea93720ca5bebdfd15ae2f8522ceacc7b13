      "message": "This looks good, I think the tool(\"cxx_module\"), etc. makes sense. I\u0027m going to do some testing now.\n\nSome thoughts/questions (maybe these will become obvious when I actually try it...):\n\n- I don\u0027t understand what \"header_modules\" is for, i.e. could we drop it and have the existence of \"module_name\" \u003d\u003e header_modules\u003dtrue?\n\n- nit; Possibly we should rename the variables to be cc_module_name, cc_module_map (or something) to disambiguate from rust/dart/whatever that probably have modules too.\n\n- Since this is quite large, maybe to make progress it would make sense to start with explicit modulemap only? i.e. the user must provide a manually written modulemap, and then we could exclude all the parts related to generating modulemap files from deps in the first CL. And we could try working on libc++-as-module since that\u0027s probably a tricky one.\n\n- I think we can ignore the warning about instability of modulemap https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#module-map-language and add a versioning variable if/when that becomes necessary.\n\n\n",

      "message": "Hello everyone, Can you invite me to join [Chromium slack](https://chromium.slack.com/)? I have no `*.google.com` email to join. So I need you to invite me. Chromium docs say you can send me invited link.\n\nI am reviewing `Chromium` source code for more than 3 months. It is very, very, very big. I am very, very, very painful to understand its all source code. So I need much talking.\n\nThank you for your patient guide. `GN` and `Gerrit` give me a interesting and meaningful travel.",

From experiments, it seems this will perfectly fit our needs (achieving kind of \"partial configuration\" of chromium to share the icu library between Chrome and CrOS). Thanks!\n\nBest,\nHonglin",

Needless to say, I\u0027m not super enthusiastic about adding it back.\n\nCan you please follow up on the email thread? Dirk had some good suggestions that you did not reply to.",

      "message": "I am sorry, but I do not understand this code. `IsGreater\u003cT, R\u003e::value` is a compile-time constant here, so where is the max comparison performed at runtime now?\n\nAt least the previous version called a function `IsGreater\u003cT,R\u003e::Test()` which doesn\u0027t seem the case now.\n\nThis is very subtle code, and we don\u0027t have proper unit-tests for it, so I\u0027d rather leave it as-is, or update to upstream instead of trying to modify it.\n\nI am putting a preventive -2 here until this is sorted out.",

      "message": "That sounds like a good plan. Fuchsia\u0027s GN roller is on a 12 hr cadence, but it looks like I have permissions to manually trigger it. I would assume Chromium has a similar GN roller, but I can\u0027t seem to find it. \n\nShould we also send out a PSA to users? While it seems like no one has really noticed the source_set phony targets yet (it has been used in Fuchsia for over a week now), this one will be more noticeable. In particular, the amount of ninja actions drops dramatically. Depending on the build config, the build will have about 40-60% less actions.",

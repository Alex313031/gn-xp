      "message": "There\u0027s an issue with this CL, I removed -Ldependency when a --extern was added to the command line, but that\u0027s incorrect. If you have:\n\nA -\u003e B -\u003e C\n  -\u003e C\n  \nAnd you write `extern crate C` in B\u0027s lib.rs.\n\nThen when compiling A, rustc still needs -Ldependency for C, or it can\u0027t satisfy the requirement from B.\n\nI will put this back adjust the tests.\n\nBut I am also seeing in Chromium that it fails to build if we don\u0027t also add the -Ldependency for B, and I don\u0027t fully get that. I will work on that tomorrow.",

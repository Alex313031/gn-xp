      "message": "If this is accurate by a simple reading, then the example below is not representative.  The example *won\u0027t* always overwrite `foo`--it will be an error if `foo` is a non-empty aggregate.  I think the semantics of the example are what we want, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what this description says.  Whichever semantics we actually wind up with, I think this description needs to be explicit about the distinction here and say whether it behaves like the example below or like a `\"*\"` case would (the only thing anywhere in GN that clobbers non-empty aggregates except by explicit assign-to-empty).",

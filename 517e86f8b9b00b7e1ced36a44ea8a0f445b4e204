      "message": "Thanks, this look good to me. This breaks the Fuchsia build, but I have uploaded https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1111713 to set `no_stamp_files \u003d false` in our `.gn` files and this seems to work around this for now. We\u0027ll have time to cleanup our actions to create depfile parent directories later.\n\nCan I ask you to add one specific unit-test that verifies the Ninja output when `no_stamp_files \u003d false` though? This may help catch regressions in the future.",

      "message": "Thank you!\n\nNo ETA yet, but I hope to convince upstream Ninja to revive https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/pull/1849 since this will get rid of our issues.\n\nOtherwise, cleanup up our build may take some time, as the failures are flaky.\nThe reason for this is that we have many sets of actions that write to the same `target_out_dir`, and breakage happens depending on which command is run first by Ninja (even in clean builds), so problematic actions could go unnoticed for a very long time.",

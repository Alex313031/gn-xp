      "message": "Thanks, this look good to me. This breaks the Fuchsia build, but I have uploaded https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1111713 to set `no_stamp_files \u003d false` in our `.gn` files and this seems to work around this for now. We\u0027ll have time to cleanup our actions to create depfile parent directories later.\n\nCan I ask you to add one specific unit-test that verifies the Ninja output when `no_stamp_files \u003d false` though? This may help catch regressions in the future.",

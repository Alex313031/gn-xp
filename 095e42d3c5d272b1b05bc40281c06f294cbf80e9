      "message": "There is something weird here because the source code you modified seems correct, even for C++20. Also please do not add hundreds of compiler warnings in a commit message, it\u0027s just noise that is painful to read for everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, the warning that says `accessing 9223372036854775810 or more bytes at offsets -4611686018427387902 and [-4611686018427387903, 4611686018427387904] may overlap up to 9223372036854775813 bytes at offset -3` is non-sensical given the code base.\n\nAre you sure there is not something terribly wrong with your compiler? Can you give more information about the issue?",

Sorry about that.\n\nIs there something terrible wrong with the compiler? probably yes :), but it is the compiler used in the Debian builders... The workarounds do not seem very terrible.\n\nI can land them as debian/patches, but then every other distro will handle this error differently.\n\n[1] https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/generate-ninja",

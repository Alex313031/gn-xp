You might have multiple different Rust toolchains, but this only supports one, so for targets using other toolchains this is going to  produce incorrect data. Furthermore, in Fuchsia we also allow overriding the toolchain for testing (see https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/build/rust/config.gni#22), whenever you use that argument, you have to also change --rust-sysroot accordingly which is error prone.",

      "message": "That would be better, but we don\u0027t want to have everyone install a package that virtually no one would need.\n\nWe could modify the script to support an `--all` flag or something like that would be used on the builders, though. \n\nAnother downside is that install-build-deps is in the Chromium repo, and chromium wouldn\u0027t use this. We kinda instead want an install-build-deps in the GN repo.\n\nThere are other ways in infra that we can add packages on just a few machines for builders; it\u0027s not actually clear if one of them would be better or worse than a GN install-build-deps equivalent.",

      "message": "I know that digit@ suggested those changes saying that the previous CL introduced a semantic changes if the define were passed on the command-line (i.e. invoking the compiler with `-DCOMPILER_GCC\u003d0`).\n\nHowever, I think making the change here is inconsistent with both Chromium (where this file was taken from) and the rest of the file.\n\n`COMPILER_GCC` is not supposed to be defined on the command-line, it is defined in //build/build_config.h, and either is not defined, or is defined to `1`. Additionally, just in the current file, there are three other occurrences of `#if defined(COMPILER_GCC)` without checking the value, and I don\u0027t think we should just change that one occurence.",

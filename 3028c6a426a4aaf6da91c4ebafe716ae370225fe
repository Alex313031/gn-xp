      "message": "Agree with leaving current tests in place, however this one was testing a case that was never used in practice (ESCAPE_NINJA_COMMAND with extra JSON escaping), and which is no longer supported. With the boolean argument removed, it\u0027s identical to the previous test and so I removed it.",

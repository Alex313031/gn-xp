      "message": "This isn\u0027t quite right because it doesn\u0027t take into account shadowing of values. If the scope and it\u0027s containing scope both have \"a\" definitions, I think this code will count it as 2 values, but really there\u0027s only one.\n\nI think there are also some other problems related to shadowing values when checking containing scopes.",

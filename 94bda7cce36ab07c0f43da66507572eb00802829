It looks weird to me and in this case seems to hurt readability.\n\nI thought the old code was fine. There are a couple of cases where the )\" collides and these use a raw string annotation thing that\u0027s different. It uses \"/\" which is OK and more readable to me than \"gn\" which looks to me like part of the string. Personally, I use a \"*\" in these cases but / is fine.",

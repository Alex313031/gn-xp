      "message": "tmandry@ hello. Would you be kind enough to take a first look here before we pass onto Petr/Brett?\n\nWe\u0027ve discussed this sort of change in the past.\n\nWe need to provide the correct -D and -I flags to bindgen, built using all the flags accumulated from all the configs throughout the source tree.\n\nThe current way to do that is to declare an extra \"toolchain\", but this toolchain gets fed every .cc file, resulting in thousands of extra build steps when we really just want to run bindgen over a single header file.\n\nWith this relatively small change, we can instead access the -D and -I flags directly from a gn \u0027action\u0027.\n\nIf you approve of the broad concept, then I\u0027ll pass this onto the gn owners for review of the details.",

      "message": "Interesting! I think this could be very useful to integrate other languages and compilers also (e.g. how Go is kind of hacked in). My understanding is you only added the variables you listed to action().\n\nBut I think if we\u0027re going to do this it\u0027s worth being general and I think we should make configs and config values work generally for actions and action_foreach.\n\nI think this means adding \"configs\" and \"public_configs\" support for actions, supporting config variables (defines, etc.) directly on action[_foreach] targets. Hopefully this should be pretty easy to implement since it already exists for other target types.\n\nWhat do you think?",

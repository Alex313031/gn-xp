      "message": "What about minimum requirements for other projects that use GN?\n\nAs far as I know, Pigweed currently supports Mojave (10.14): https://pigweed.dev/docs/faq.html#what-development-hosts-are-supported\n\nFor Fuchsia, I canÂ´t find our minimum requirements on fuchsia.dev, but Peter might now.\n\nI don\u0027t know what a project like V8, which provides its own GN-based build system to build outside of Chromium mandates as well, but their documentation states that the generated binaries should run on 10.12, so I guess they may want to support older systems for building too?\n\nSince this has the potential of breaking the GN binary for some users outside of Chromium, I recommend sending an announcement to gn-dev before submitting this.",

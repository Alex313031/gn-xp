      "message": "Forgive my amateur C++. From testing locally this has made rust-analyzer a lot more helpful in cases where the same set of Rust source files is built by multiple GN targets that may themselves depend on different crates. (I think the universal `\"cfg\": [\"test\"]` that we already emit for each crate in rust-project.json is an attempt to address this, but it only works for getting rust-analyzer to understand test-only code _in the current crate_ -- it still won\u0027t let rust-analyzer understand test_deps if the test version of the crate wasn\u0027t first in rust-project.json.)",

      "message": "Hm, we have a private dep of a C staticlib in our transitive Rust deps. Whether C staticlib or Rust crate_type \u003d \"staticlib\" I don\u0027t think that makes much sense. Both should hide any Rust code that exists in them and only expose C APIs.\n\nI doubt this is *hurting* anything especially since it\u0027s not listed in `--extern`, but it\u0027s worth pointing out and if there\u0027s a painless fix we should do it. If the fix adds much complexity, it may not be worth it.",

      "message": "nit: since this is modifying a global, it\u0027 simpler to let the caller deal with the fd redirection itself. Also RunDesc() could simply have an extra `Setup* setup \u003d nullptr` parameter, and only allocate a new Setup object if `nullptr` was passed. That would avoid introducing a new function, which is nicer since we plan to do the same for other read-only query commands (e.g. `refs`, `path`, `outputs`).",

      "message": "Long term, it\u0027s probably a better idea to use a path that ends with a small hash of the current directory\u0027s absolute path. This will allow several servers to run concurrently, when used from different workspaces.\n\nI recommend moving the socket connection / binding to a dedicated class, in order to make it easier to later improve to support non-Linux systems (i.e. using a NamedPipe on Win32, or a Unix pipe on OSX/BSDs with a $HOME/.config/var/xxx filesystem entry, and possibly a `.pid` file to check for liveliness in case of server crash).",

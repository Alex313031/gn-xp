      "message": "This change exposed an interesting issue, manifesting in the Fuchsia build. The short version is that neither GN or Ninja will explicitly generate an output directory for a depfile. Fuchsia\u0027s host_tool_action was specifying a depfile as part of a generated_file output, but the depfile\u0027s directory was not created because there was no longer a stamp output file.\n\nI\u0027ll create a bug on Ninja for not generating output directories for depfiles, but Fuchsia has a workaround in flight here: https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/427929.

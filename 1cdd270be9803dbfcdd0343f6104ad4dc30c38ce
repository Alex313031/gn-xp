I\u0027ll send an email to the mailing list to discuss.",

I hope it will help understand the ideas behind these changes.\n\nNote that so far only support classes have been added in the previous submits. There is no GN change at runtime so far, they all happen in the CLs above this one.\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/gn-dev/c/GIDBLOOd9as/m/p4UHiLk5AgAJ",

      "message": "First, I wouldn\u0027t call the ending-in-a-slash condition \"normalized\" because I don\u0027t think there is an expected type of input here.\n\nSecond, I believe this function is called a lot (several tens of thousands of times in a Chrome run) and I went through some effort to try to not copy strings. That\u0027s why this function takes a StringPiece.\n\nI didn\u0027t spend any time thinking about implementation details, but is it possible to implement in a different way to avoid reallocating the string here? If you find in the vast majority of calls it always has a slash maybe we could allocate only in those cases, but I suspect this isn\u0027t the case and if we can make the implementation more sensitive about handling end-of-string it would probably be better.",

      "message": "Can you leave the comment you made on this change about the trailing slash here in the code? I\u0027d probably also add a TODO and say that if we go over the entire codebase and clean up every invocation of this function that doesn\u0027t pass a path with trailing slash, this could be replaced with a DCHECK to enforce that source_root ends with slash.",

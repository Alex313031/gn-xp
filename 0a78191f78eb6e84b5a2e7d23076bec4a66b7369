      "message": "This CL differs from Petr\u0027s CL in a few ways:\n\n  * This is stripped down to just the restat portion. clean_stale is a separate CL\n  * We only have the command-line switch for --ninja-executable, but we will also attempt to fall back to a ninja binary in the path. This was based on Brett\u0027s comment in the previous CL.\n  * We run the ninja binary to determine the version instead of relying on the build configuration\u0027s required version. I worry about relying on the ninja output, but it means the subset of users that don\u0027t require 1.10, but actually use it can benefit from the restat.",

      "message": "Do you know how much this slows down GN for a gen run? I\u0027m especially worried about Windows.\n\nWe have ninja_required_version in the .gn file. Can we use that value instead of running GN? The reason against would be that maybe I have the new version of Ninja installed but the current project doesn\u0027t require it. But Chrome uses an older Ninja and it won\u0027t work with the new one, and Fuchsia uses the newer one and I don\u0027t think it works with the older one. I suspect at least across the versions we\u0027re talking about, Ninja isn\u0027t very compatible. So that maybe indicates this reason against just using the required version isn\u0027t important.",

      "message": "I found the version check to have a fairly negligible impact on my machine, but that\u0027s probably not very representative of the general user. FWIW, running gn gen on example/simple_build indicated that the version check cost about 2ms. On a fuchsia build, it was entirely in the noise. \n\nI would definitely agree that different versions of ninja do not play nicely with one another. I tried running some of the tools using a ninja 1.10 binary on a Chromium build, and found they could create some breakage. Cleandead failed due to ninja deps file format changes. A restat on build.ninja seemingly succeeded, but it introduced a higher resolution timestamp into the build log, which then resulted in a re-gen on next ninja run. \n\nGiven this, is it still reasonable to fall back to using ninja from the PATH? My concern is projects that provide an in-tree prebuilt ninja conflicting with a ninja in the user\u0027s PATH. This could lead to some subtle breakage.",

      "message": "This CL differs from Petr\u0027s CL in a few ways:\n\n  * This is stripped down to just the restat portion. clean_stale is a separate CL\n  * We only have the command-line switch for --ninja-executable, but we will also attempt to fall back to a ninja binary in the path. This was based on Brett\u0027s comment in the previous CL.\n  * We run the ninja binary to determine the version instead of relying on the build configuration\u0027s required version. I worry about relying on the ninja output, but it means the subset of users that don\u0027t require 1.10, but actually use it can benefit from the restat.",

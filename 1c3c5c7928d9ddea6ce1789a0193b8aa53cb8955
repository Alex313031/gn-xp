      "message": "This CL is ready for discussion too now (including having a unittest). Previously (circa patchset 16) I had the module dependencies in a separate new variable `module_deps`.\n\nPer discussion on the previous CL, it\u0027s now in just in normal deps.\n\nThe pros of using module_deps are that it makes it a bit more clear what\u0027s going on in the build file. I thought it might allow for simpler migration too, because the targets that depend on a module can choose whether they depend on it as a normal target, or a snazzy new module target.\n\nPutting it in deps (as now implemented) means that the depender can\u0027t pick -- if it\u0027s a module, then it\u0027s always a module, so the depender has to be \"well-behaved\" which might make some transitions trickier. But, it keeps the concepts down, and avoids introducing yet-another-flavour of deps which is a good thing. It\u0027s likely also better long-term to not have the user choice.\n\nOn the whole though, the quite-a-bit-smaller size of this CL convinces me this is the way to go for now.",

      "message": "@dpranke@google.com: i finally invested the time to figure out why gn sometimes crashes when regenerating build files. i\u0027m fairly sure it\u0027s due to a/v interfering with the call to `ReplaceFile` in `WriteFileAtomically`. i\u0027ll fix that in a separate CL. this here just fixes the crash shortly after since an `Err` wasn\u0027t being set in this case. with this change, the error i\u0027m hitting is reported as `ERROR Failed to write build.ninja.` rather than a crash. please send to the CQ if you approve (i don\u0027t have perms to commit in this repo). thank you!",

      "message": "I also tested in Fuchsia\u0027s build here: https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/414658 which seems correct insofar as the .ninja and resulting errors look correct.\n\nOne thing I realized that\u0027s sort of obvious, but I hadn\u0027t thought about it: the .cc need to depend on the .pcm, and today continue to depend on .h via .d, etc. So the .ninja files are going to get a bit bigger. But if you were fully converted to modules you could completely drop .h and -MF, etc. other than for the building of .pcm which would be pretty cool.",

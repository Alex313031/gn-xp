      "message": "Hmm ... if I\u0027m understanding the code correctly, this\u0027ll handle the case where `--script-executable\u003dc:\\src\\depot_tools\\python3.bat` (as you note), but it won\u0027t handle `--script-executable\u003dpython3` if python3.bat is in the path, right? Because the PythonBatToExe logic won\u0027t be called in the latter case?\n\nIf so, we still can\u0027t set script_executable in the dotfile a la https://crrev.com/c/2515787; that would need a subsequent patch to either do something like allow for host_os to be used in a conditional during dotfile processing or to do a path search/converstion if the script executable is missing an extension, right?\n\nAnyone have thoughts on which of these is preferable? Or both?",
